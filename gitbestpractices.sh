Git Best Practices:
    Use branching strategy and pull requests
    Commit once you finish the task. 
    Avoid merge Conflicts.
    Donâ€™t Commit Half-Done - git stash
    Test your code before commit.
    Write Good Commit Messages before committing 
    Try to use git commands rather than GUI tools.
    use ssh url and PAT over https 
    use rebase over git merge
